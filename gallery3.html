    <h1>Love Luna Artisanal Gelato</h1>
    <h2>Role: Logo and Identity Branding- Art direction- Advertising</h2>
    <p>The design brief for this project asked us to create  an identity for a “hip” eatery that primarily sold “hand-crafted” artisanal gelato. These venues (located in Japan, New York and Brazil) )were to create an atmosphere that was clean, international, and appealing to more sophisticated types. I came up with various logos and art direction for this project, and decided to use the company name to drive the logo design.</p>
    <p>The logotype is hand drawn to reflect the hand-crafted one of a kind products that this business produces. The actual logo is an ice cream cone illustration that has bounced light that also works as a moon in the composition.When interpreted in abstraction, “Love Luna Artisan Studio Gelato”, could mean “Love and eat our fancy ice cream at night”…</p>
    <p>The second half of this project was to art direct and develop advertising for billboards and magazines. I came up with 3 contrasting solutions. The first concept is a composition of children eating ice cream with the company tagline written across the page. This concept was meant to appeal more to families and relate to people who remember eating ice cream as a child. The second concept is an overhead photo of  their product. The neon pink color of the ice cream is attention gathering and “edgy”. The last ad concept is also an overhead photo of the gelato being hand mixed over cold marble- which helps to emphasize the unique and “hand-crafted” value that this business is attempting to promote.</p>
