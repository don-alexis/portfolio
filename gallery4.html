    <h2>Rebranding Proposal</h2>
    <p>Here is a logo redesign I created for the YMCA.  This non-profit organization has had a number of logo redesigns throughout its existence and with the election of the new chair, I thought it fitting to design a new version of the logo.  Inspiration for the redesign included a survey of logos done in the past and evaluating the brand values. From this, I summed up that the YMCA was a safe place for recreation and activities. This idea led me to creating a storyboard that involved swimming pools and running tracks.</p>
    <p>I implemented the idea of motion, recreation and activity by creating parallel lines that run along the left side of the letter y’s arm and stem. I kept the letter y and the triangle in the composition to maintain consistent to the brand’s history. I believe this solution, is already familiar, and not too much of a derivation from what’s been done in the past; but it’s also different enough of a change to be noticed- an upgrade from what already exists.</p>
