    <h1>Mask of Fear</h1>
    <h2>Role: Motion Graphics</h2>
    <p>This is a title sequence that I created for a documentary about the Bauhaus School, titled: “Mask of Fear”. In this sequence I used AfterEffects and my digital compositing skills to tell the story using a technique inspired by Ken Burns. The images that I used were found from the internet and required a lot of work to get it in a more workable form.</p>
