    <h1>Skrillex</h1>
    <h2>Role: Digital Imaging and Compositing</h2>
    <p>This is a portrait I created using images that were gathered from the internet. I used a number of layers and masking techniques to create the portrait of Skrillex (all the reference images you see here were used to create the illustration). From there, I placed the portrait unto a mockup template of a record album cover. The composition is inspired by one of the art pieces in the collection of gathered images. Can you guess which one?</p>
