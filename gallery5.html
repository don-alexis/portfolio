    <h1>Mount Auburn Hospital</h1>
    <h2>Designer: Hospital Graphics System</h2>
    <p>Mount Auburn Hospital is a hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, affiliated with Harvard Medical School. It was founded in 1886 as the first hospital in Cambridge and until 1947 was known as Cambridge Hospital.</p>
    <p>Mount Auburn Hospital wanted some simple designs for various marketing collateral. This project involved creating designs for a brochure, a buckslip, postcards, letterhead, envelopes, a tri-fold brochure, and medical forms. I took their existing logo and color pallet to create designs that align themselves to what can be found in hospital graphic systems.</p>
