    <h2>Role: Magazine cover and feature story layout.- Winter 2013</h2>
    <p>This project involved creating a compelling cover design for Allure magazine. The project reveals my ability to adapt and create content for subject matter that isn’t necessarily relatable to my personal life. I was challenged to go out of my comfort zone and find a design solution that this particular businesses’ target demographic would find interest in. In case you haven’t figured it out, Allure is primarily a women’s magazine.</p>
    <p>At the time, Jennifer Lawrence was the “it” girl; so I used her as the feature story for this issue. The second part of my task was to design a page layout for a feature story about the latest trend: “Frilly and Feathery miniskirts. Th design for the miniskirt story was inspired from a page layout design on a story about Louis C.K. found in Rolling Stone Magazine. Ironically, Louis C.K.  has nothing to do with women’s fashion (or miniskirts), but the graphical style used to present Louis’ story was adaptable to this story for women.</p>
