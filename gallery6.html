    <h2>Flash Microsites</h2>
    <p>Below are  links to a series of flash websites that I created for Ocean Park Entertainment Group.  OPEG is a family of investors and restauranteurs that own a series of bars in Santa Monica, Hollywood, San Fernando Valley and Downtown Los Angeles. All these bars have a familiar look, feel, and clientele. I was lucky enough to work with this group to not only design their websites,  but to program the music there as well.</p>
    <p>These sites were made in the mid 2000â€™s, during the height of when flash was all the buzz. Technology since that time has evolved and the popularity of iOS mobile devices has since then diminished the value of flash. The micro sites that I designed were for
