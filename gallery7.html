    <h1>“Glint” - Wordpress Theme</h1>
    <h2>Role: Develop and Design a Content Management System using Wordpress</h2>
    <p>This wordpress theme is a single page web application that is responsive and optimized to fit on any device. This particular theme includes demonstrations of my ability to use CSS animations, is parallaxed enabled, has various types of image galleries, varying page templates within the sites’ CMS.</p>
    <p>The overall theme and inspiration for this design was derived from the punk rock era. I used the color pink along with black and white imagery to establish a look and feel that is edgy, “rad” , but yet posh.</p>
    <p>The live example of this site can be seen  <a href="_glint/" target="_blank"> HERE</a></p>
