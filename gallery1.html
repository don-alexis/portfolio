    <h2>Role: Magazine cover and feature story layout- Fall 2013 </h2>
    <p>This project involved coming up with a theme for an upcoming issue of Photoplus magazine.  This publication is known for giving the  latest tips and tricks for the latest Canon cameras out in the market and my job for this project was to design the cover and a feature story within the issue.</p>
    <p>I came up with a special “Black and White Edition” for this project.. Photoplus magazine primarily focuses on on vibrant, colorful, and visually compelling still images taken with Canon cameras, but I though it would be more interesting to create an issue that featured the beauty of black and white photography.</p>
    <p>It’s kind of  award sell to convince editors of a publication that’s in the business of color pictures to try and sell the idea of black and white, but the direction was a good idea to break the monotony of continually producing color issues.</p>
