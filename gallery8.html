    <h1>Compositing</h1>
    <h2>Role: Image retouching and compositing</h2>
    <p>These are a series of personal works that I created to demonstrate some compositing and digital imaging techniques using photoshop.</p>
    <p>The first composition shows a couple on a canoe rowing up a building trying to reach the pristine waters on the top.</p>
    <p>The second composition is herd of elephants rampaging through Buckingham palace.</p>
    <p>The third composition is similar to the first, but I used a horse race instead.</p>
    <p>The last composition is an illustration of heavenly bodies that are cubicle and covered with water. </p>
