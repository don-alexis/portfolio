    <h1>David Bowie</h1>
    <p>This is a personal project I created using a David Bowie photo reference and illustrating it with a polygonal/3d effect. This project required me to map a number of triangles across Bowie's face. After the illustration was created, I applied the image on a cd mockup template to verify the effectiveness of the concept.</p>
